            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Toronto Cupcake was created by Michelle Harrison so she could pursue her love of baking. A lifelong baker, inspired by her mother, Michelle opened Toronto Cupcake in August 2010 as one of Canada's first gourmet cupcakeries. We are driven by loving what we do and what we make everyday. We get to use the finest ingredients to make what we believe are the tastiest treats around. And.. we love the idea that our treats are making people happy.</p>

            <p>Our cupcake delivery service operates 7 days a week, reaching areas within an 80km radius of Toronto. It's a breeze to send cupcakes with our service.

                You can often place your order for same-day delivery. However, for deliveries outside downtown Toronto, please order by the evening prior. Morning delivery is generally reserved for M** postal codes.
                
                Enjoy free delivery to downtown Toronto when you order three dozen cupcakes or more. For other locations, delivery fees are significantly reduced.
                
                We deliver to several locations, including Oakville, Aurora, Markham, Scarborough, Vaughan, Ajax, and Pickering, among others.
                
                Delivery fees are determined by the postal code of the delivery location and, in certain cases, the time of day.</p>
